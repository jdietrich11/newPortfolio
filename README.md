This is a new updated version of a portfolio website to test my skills

I feel like my skills have improved and thought a new portfolio would be good to showcase new things as well as push myself even further. Plus I never really loved v1, it was good, not great.

IDEA's
aphantasia - start on an all black screen and uncover the website as they move their mouse. (like Fog of war).

don't use projects from Udemy courses, only projects I've built.
