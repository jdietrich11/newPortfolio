    question: "How did you start",
    answer:
      "I began by taking an HTML and CSS course on UDEMY. My cousin Jeremy recommended that I learn JavaScript and not make a decision until I built a BlackJack game using it. So on UDEMY I took mulitiple JavaScript courses in order to better understand it. Then I built my game. He told me that programming is a-lot of smacking your head against a wall but once you get passed it, it can feel great. Being a person who likes to solve puzzles, this drew more interest.",
