    question: "How did you start",
    answer:
      "I began by taking an HTML and CSS course on UDEMY. My mentor Jeremy recommended that I learn JavaScript and not make a decision until I built a BlackJack game using it. So using UDEMY I took mulitiple JavaScript courses in order to better understand it. Then I built my game. He told me that programming is a-lot of smacking your head against a wall but once you get passed it, it can feel great. Being a person who likes to solve puzzles, this drew more interest.",

    answer:
      "Never have I ever been haunted by a game I didn't play. I bought this game when it first came out in 2015. I played it and could not, for the life of me, get past the 2nd boss Father Gascoigne. For years I kept going back to play this game because the atmosphere was so inticing. This game stuck in my head so much until in 2018 after my first semster of college I finally played it continously to get past this part and beat the game! I have played through the story multiple times sense and as of right now is the only game I have 100% completed. The feeling when finally beating a boss was an addictive feeling. Never before had I played a game with such interesting lore, story-telling methods, and atmosphere.",
